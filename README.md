# Tic Tac Toe Challenge

## Objective
Create a Tic Tac Toe (Naughts and Crosses) game web application to practise JavaScript programming skills.

## Planning Template

### Game Rules
Outline the rules of Tic Tac Toe. Define win conditions.
- **Rules Here:**

### User Interface Design
Use Figma or similar tool to design the game board layout and visual elements. Include screenshots in this section.

### Game Logic
Break down game logic, including player moves and win conditions. Define data structure for game state representation.

In this phase, aim to write down as much as you can about how your game will function. The more detailed your plan, the smoother your coding process will be. Write down your thoughts on every aspect of the game, from how players will interact with it to how the game will respond. Don't worry about making it perfectâ€”just get your ideas down on paper. This will make it much easier when you start coding, as you'll have a clear roadmap to follow. Decide on the different parts of the game and how they'll work together. Consider what variables and structures you'll use to store important information, like the game board and player moves.

### Project Requirements

1. **User Interface**
   - Design a user-friendly game interface with clear instructions and feedback for players.
   - Example: "Display whose turn it is, show messages for win/draw outcomes, and provide a button to reset the game."

2. **Functionality**
   - Implement the game logic accurately according to the rules of Tic Tac Toe.
   - Example: "Ensure that players can only place their marker in empty spaces and that the game correctly identifies win and draw conditions."

3. **Code Quality**
   - Write clean, well-commented code with meaningful variable and function names.
   - Example: "Use descriptive variable names like 'playerTurn' and 'gameBoard' to improve readability. Add comments to explain complex logic."

4. **User Experience**
   - Provide clear feedback to players at each stage of the game.
   - Example: "Display messages to indicate whose turn it is and when the game ends. Consider adding visual cues for player moves."
